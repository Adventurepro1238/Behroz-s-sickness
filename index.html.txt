<h1>Why behroz is Behroz sick?</h1>
<hr/>
<h2> Reasons supported by evidence: </h2>
<h4>1: MAN GOT NO HEATER:</h4>
<p>Based on an investigation launched in 2023: Behroz was found in places lacking heaters; however initially this was not a problem. Recent developments in decreasing temparture have lead to gargantuan health problems for behroz - some say he might not make it.</p>
<h4>2:BRO DOESNT KNOW HOW TO USE A BLANKET:</h4>
<p>Parents have shared concerns regarding Behroz's blanket habits. Her mother has qouted to have said, "The day he was born we wrapped him in a blanket... He would not stay in!!!'while wiping her tears'; he kept taking it off till only his feet were in-'Crying Intensifies'"Hence we are to conclude that this is another factor surmounting to Behroz's conditon. </p>
<h4>3:SKILL ISSUE:</h4>
<p>...............¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<h2>Concluding poem:</h2>
<p>Sick, young Behroz is, from cold so grim,<br/>
    Ailing he feels, his chances seem slim.<br/>
    Anakin the cat, evil and sly,<br/>
    In shadows he lurks, ready to pry.<br/>
    <br/>
    But brave is Behroz, though fevered his head,<br/>
    With Jedi-like strength, he rises from bed.<br/>
    The battle begins, between boy and beast,<br/>
    In the cold's dark grip, he finds his release.<br/>
    <br/>
    With force of will, and courage untold,<br/>
    Behroz conquers the cold, brave and bold.</p>
